## AIM:
To write a Java program to find the factorial of a given number.

## ALGORITHM :
1. Read an integer n from the user.
2. Initialize a variable fact to 1.
3. Use a loop to multiply fact by each number from 1 to n.
4. Store the final product in fact.
5. Display the factorial of the given number.

## SOURCE CODE:
```
import java.util.*;
public class main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = input.nextInt();
        int fact=1;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
                 fact *=i;
        }
        System.out.println("Factorial of "+n+" is: "+fact);
    }
}

```
